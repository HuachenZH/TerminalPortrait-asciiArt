features to develop:
- set level of precision (use how many different characters to make the portrait)
- set character length (@@ or @@@), depending on input image size. I call it inkDensity.
- color to grayscale [OK]
    - 3D array, identify who is r, who is g, who is b [OK]
    - function isGrayscale, check if the matrix/image is already grayscaled [OK]
    - integrate fct isGrayscale [OK]
    - function color to greyscale: x = 0.299r + 0.587g + 0.114b. [OK]
    - implement the function [OK]
        - divided by... (set levels) 
        - use mapping dictionary instead of if
    - test script [OK]
- rescale image (width must be < 500 px)
- restructure code, wrap in fct [OK]
- a progress bar may be cool
- call the script from terminal, no need to open the script then run [OK]
    - try using argparse, analyse fonctionnelle
        - the script can be run in the terminal like: $ python test-type.py -i inputpath -o outputpath
        - which arguments are required ? >>> input image (path+name), output (path+name), ink level, ink density
        - so it will be like: $ python test-type.py -i inputpath -o outputpath -l inkLevel -d inkDensity
        - to make it simple, lets suppose both paths are absolute path
- it's running well... however the input image need to be high contrasted :(
